                    <h4>The domestication of horses</h4>
                    <p>
                        <strong>A</strong> Horses have been racing across the landscape for around 55 million years – 
much longer than our own species has existed. However, prehistoric remains 
show that at the end of the Ice Age, some 10,000 years ago, wild horses died 
out in the Americas and dwindled in western Europe, for reasons that are not 
clear. But they continued to thrive on the steps of eastern Europe and Central 
Asia, where short grasses and shrubs grow on vast, dry stretches of land. Most 
scholars believe it was here that people domesticated the horse. However, the 
DNA of domestic horses is very diverse. This suggests they may be descended 
from a number of different wild horse populations, in several locations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         <strong>B</strong> Once horses and humans encountered each other, our two species became 
powerfully linked. Humans domesticated horses some 6,000 years ago, and over 
time, we have created more than 200 breeds. The first domestic horses were 
likely to have been kept mainly as a source of food, rather than for work or for 
riding. There is evidence of horses being raised for meat in Kazakhstan, in Central 
Asia, around 5,500 years ago; later they began to pull chariots, and horseback 
riding became common in Afghanistan and Iran about 4,000 years ago. As we 
have shaped horses to suit our needs on battlefields, farms and elsewhere, these 
animals have shaped human history. The ways we travel, trade, play, work and 
f
ight wars have all been profoundly shaped by our use of horses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>C</strong> When people domesticate animals, they control their behavior in many ways. For 
example, animals that are being domesticated no longer choose their own mates. 
Instead, people control their breeding. Individuals with traits that humans prefer 
are more likely to produce offspring and pass on their genes. In the course of 
several generations, both the body and behavior of the animal are transformed. 
In the wild, animals that are well adapted to their environment live long and 
reproduce, while others die young. In this way, nature “chooses” the traits that 
are passed on to the next generation. This is the process of evolution by natural 
selection. Domestic animals also evolve, but people do the selecting. Humans 
seek out qualities like tameness, and help animals with those traits to survive and 
bear young. This is evolution by artificial selection. Most domestic animals are 
naturally social. Their wild ancestors lived in groups, with individuals responding 
to each other – some led, others followed. In domestic animals, the tendency to 
submit to others is especially strong. Generations of breeding have encouraged 
them to let people take the lead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <strong>D</strong> For more than 3,000 years, a fighter on horseback or horse-drawn chariot was the 
ultimate weapon. Time after time, from Asia to Europe to the Americas, the use 
of horses has changed the balance of power between civilizations. When people 
with horses clashed with those without, horses provided a huge advantage. 
When both sides had horses, battles turned on the strength and strategy of their 
mounted horsemen, or cavalry. Horses continued to define military tactics well into 
the 1900s, until they finally became outmoded by machine guns, tanks, airplanes 
and other modern weapons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>E</strong> Horses are built for power. Their muscular bodies are heavier in the front than in 
the back, making them well balanced to pull heavy loads. Yet they can also be 
agile and quick – fit to carry out difficult tasks at top speed. So for more than a 
thousand years, people have called on the power of horses to cultivate the land 
and manage livestock.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>F</strong> For most of human history, there was no faster way to travel over land than on 
a horse. When it comes to carrying people and their possessions, horses have 
two important advantages – they can run very fast and very far. Their speed 
and endurance are unusual for a creature so large, making them the most 
suitable animals to carry people and goods around the world. Horses offer other 
advantages as well. Since they eat grass, they can go almost anywhere that 
humans can, eating as they go. And unlike cows and camels, which must sit 
and rest to digest food, a horse’s digestive system allows it to graze and walk 
the whole day without stopping. By carrying people, goods and ideas between 
civilizations, horses changed history.
                    <p>
                        <strong>G</strong> Today’s horses are not used to carry soldiers into battle, and do not pull plows and 
stage-coaches as they once did. But horses are still part of our lives. Today the 58 
million horses in the world are used more for companionship, sport and recreation 
than for work and warfare.

                    <h4>Business case study: Rebranding Shopper's Stop</h4>
                    <p>
                       On April 24, 2008, one of India’s oldest retail chains Shopper’s Stop Ltd unveiled its 
new logo as a part of its rebranding strategy. The chain undertook the rebranding 
exercise in a bid to go upmarket, and reposition itself as a ‘bridge to luxury’ store as 
opposed to its earlier image of a premium retailer. This would mean raising the already 
high quality of its products, and targeting more affluent consumers. Commenting on 
the change, B.S. Nagesh, Customer Care Associate and Managing Director, Shopper’s 
Stop, said, ‘Change is essential. Our consumers are changing; their preferences are 
constantly evolving. They are getting younger. And so, we have to change along with 
them. The change in identity is just the beginning of a wave of strategic movements 
being made in people, practices, introduction of new ways of shopping, technology, 
investment in customer relationship management, and analytics.’
                    </p>
                    <p>Shopper’s Stop was founded by K Raheja Corporation in October 1991, with its first 
store in Mumbai. From selling men’s ready-to-wear clothing it soon evolved into a 
complete family lifestyle store. As of 2008, Shopper’s Stop had 1.3 million square feet 
of retail space spread across 24 stores in 11 cities in India, with a retail turnover of over 
12.07 billion rupees (approx. US$245m)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to analysts, in the mid-2000s Shopper’s Stop started to lose its market value 
as it failed to keep pace with changing customer preferences. It faced competition from 
several retailers such as Globus, Westside and Lifestyle, who were catering to the 
same segment of customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Changing consumer behaviour and the growing demand from youngsters for trendy 
products made Shopper’s Stop consider the option of rebranding itself. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It conducted a series of workshops called ‘Trial Room’, to understand the preferences 
of groups of invited consumers. The workshops revealed that what was needed was a 
change in the look and feel of the brand. For Shopper’s Stop, rebranding meant not just 
a change of logo, but the execution of new business strategies, with the core principles 
remaining intact. According to Ravi Deshpande, Chief Creative Officer with Contract 
Advertising, the agency which designed the new campaign for Shopper’s Stop, ‘The 
retailer needed its brand idea to change, in order to connect to younger people. The 
purpose was also to cut the age of the brand, as fresh ideas do help in making people 
look differently at the brand.’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a part of the rebranding efforts, Shopper’s Stop introduced a new rectangular logo 
designed by Ray+Keshavan. Though the logo was changed, the black and white colour 
scheme was retained. Govind Shrikhande, Customer Care Associate and Chief Executive of Shopper’s Stop, said, ‘It is more classical, rich, and authoritative – 
something Shopper’s customers connect with. Black and white gives us a strong brand 
recall value.’ The tagline was also changed from ‘Shopping and Beyond’ to ‘Start 
Something New’, which implied that customers should try out something different, and 
upgrade themselves according to the demands of the changing world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a part of its new philosophy of providing the customers with a new shopping 
experience, Shopper’s Stop came up with several initiatives. One plan was to increase 
the area of each store from around 40,000-45,000 square feet to 75,000-85,000 square 
feet. It also started a new concept in the retail industry by setting up trial rooms with day 
and night lighting options, so that consumers could check how garments would look 
during the day and in the night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The other initiatives included a new dress code of black and white for the employees, 
and training sessions to help employees tackle demanding customers with varied 
tastes. Shopper’s Stop also introduced a company anthem for the staff, penned by 
renowned lyricist Gulzar, and sung by popular Indian singer Sonu Nigam. It was played 
every morning across all outlets in the country as a song of celebration. Shopper’s Stop 
brought out collectible shopping bags with different themes and launched the first in 
the series based on the theme ‘Fashion for the Age’. To make shopping an enjoyable 
experience for its customers, it launched an in-store radio station in association with 
Blue Frog Media, which aired popular melodies across all its stores in India, while radio 
presenters offered tips on fashion and wellness. It also planned to start its online portal 
by the end of 2008, to enable customers to shop online.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition to these initiatives, Shopper’s Stop also started an environmental awareness 
campaign called ‘Think Green’. As part of this initiative, it planted more than 500 trees 
and distributed 1,500,000 seed sachets among its customers. Besides, a series of print 
and television commercials in black and white, with an environmental message that 
also conveyed Shopper’s Stop’s repositioning, were launched. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Shopper’s Stop planned to invest around 15 billion rupees to increase the number of 
outlets to 48 by 2011. It had earmarked 200 million rupees for the rebranding and 
repositioning exercise. But not everyone favoured the changes. Customers said that 
from their point of view, there was no major change in terms of price or special offers. 
Some analysts were of the view that the new logo had nothing unique to offer except for 
a change in shape. Some even wondered why the retailer had decided to rebrand itself, 
considering that it was doing reasonably well and had just completed a successful year.

                    <h4>Re-evaluating the role of maps</h4>
                    <p>
                        <strong>A</strong> Maps vary enormously, from imposing images of the world and its parts to private 
jottings intended to give an approximate idea of the twentieth-century Antarctic. 
The materials on which maps are to be found, similarly range from scraps of 
paper to plaster walls, by way of parchment, copper coins, mosaics, marble, 
woollen tapestries, silk, gold and more. Attitudes towards maps also vary greatly, 
and are subject to modification over time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <strong>B</strong> In recent decades, the view that maps should be assessed primarily in terms 
of their geometrical accuracy has radically changed. At the same time, they 
have become available to a range of disciplines. This development has been 
encouraged by the growing popularity of interdisciplinary studies and by the 
increasing awareness and appreciation of the importance of the visual – which 
may be a consequence of the spread of television and the internet, and the ease 
with which images can be created and manipulated in a digital environment. 
Academic historians of all types – social, political, diplomatic and fine art, literature 
specialists, and family historians take an interest in maps and find that they 
sometimes offer perspectives on their subjects that are not possible from other 
sources. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <strong>C</strong> All have contributed to a re-evaluation of the subject. It is accepted that for 
some purposes, such as administration and terrestrial and maritime navigation, 
mathematical accuracy still plays a major and even sometimes a paramount role 
in cartography. In other contexts, such as maps of underground railway systems, 
or maps used for propaganda purposes, such accuracy is irrelevant, and at 
times even undesirable. Conversely, the very aspects that tended traditionally 
to be condemned or disregarded, such as distortions and decoration, become 
of enormous significance. They can give particularly precious insights into the 
mentalities of past ages, and the views and lives of their creators, as well as being 
packed with more general cultural information such as the receptiveness to 
artistic fashions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>D</strong> For many map enthusiasts the fascination of maps ironically stems from their 
necessary lack of truth. They can be regarded as the most successful pieces of 
f
iction ever to be created because most users instinctively suspend disbelief until 
they find that the map they are using does not give truthful information. Yet it has 
to be that way. Given the impossibility of representing the total reality, with all its 
complexity, on a flat surface, hard decisions have to be taken as to what features 
to select for accurate representation, or indeed for representation at all. For most of the time this process of selection is almost instinctive. The mapmaker knows 
the purpose he intends for his map, and beyond that he is unwittingly guided by 
the values and assumptions of the time in which he lives – unless these are in 
conflict with his own value systems, as was the case with Nicholas Philpot Leader 
in 1827. The map of Ireland (then part of the UK) that Leader commissioned was 
intended as a strong attack on the then British government.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>E</strong> In order to meet the map’s purpose, the information that is represented will be 
prioritized according to importance as perceived by the mapmaker – and not 
necessarily in accordance with actual geographical size. Even on modern national 
topographic mapping, such features as motorways will be shown far larger than 
they actually are because they are important to drivers and users will expect 
to see them without difficulty. Conversely, large features that are considered 
unimportant might be completely ignored or reduced in size, like parks and other 
public spaces in some town maps. Often maps will show things that are invisible 
in the real world, such as relative financial affluence, as in Charles Booth’s maps 
of London in the nineteenth century, or the geology far below the surface of the 
planet, as in an 1823 map of the land around Bath. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>F</strong> Sometimes the purpose of the map is even simpler and has nothing to do with 
geography. The Hereford World Map proclaims the insignificance of man in the 
face of the divine and the eternal. The plan of Ostia harbour of AD 64 primarily 
serves as a demonstration of the Emperor Nero’s benevolence. Sometimes, as 
in depictions of the imaginary land of Utopia, physical reality is totally absent or 
so distorted as to be geographically meaningless. Instead the map serves as a 
commentary on the gap between the aspirations and the feeble achievements of 
mankind. The quality of a map must be judged by its ability to serve its purpose, 
and not simply by its scientific precision, and in that context aesthetic and design 
considerations are every bit as important as the mathematical, and often more so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>G</strong> Plainly, to interpret maps as having followed a path of ever-increasing scientific 
perfection over time is to miss the main point. In fact, they have responded to the 
mentalities, and met the requirements of the societies in which they have been 
created. In ancient Greece and Babylon, and in eighteenth- and twentieth-century 
Europe, the preoccupation with precision and the scientific indeed predominated. 
In early modern China and nineteenth-century Europe the administrative use of 
mapping came to the fore. By contrast, for long periods of time and in many 
civilizations, the major preoccupation was to define and to depict man’s place in 
relationship to a religious view of the universe. This was particularly evident in 
medieval Europe and Aztec Mexico. Clearly, maps can only be fully understood in 
their social context.
